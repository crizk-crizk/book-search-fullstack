# Book Search: via Google

![A look inside this application](Book-Search-app.gif)

## Description
This React app allows users to search books by any given key (author, title, subject). The results provide two options: 'View' and 'Save'. Clicking the 'View' button will redirect to Google Book's website where the user can read or purchase the book. Clicking the 'Save' button will add the book to the user's list of saved books.
